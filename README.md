# Homely

## Summary

Research indicates the average buyer will visit 10 houses
over 10 weeks before finding the right place. The search for the
perfect place to live can be a whirlwind of open houses and
scrolling through countless online listings in a short amount of
time. Homely helps you keep track of all the houses and apartments
you've visited. Quickly create a post for each place, assign it an
alias as a handy reference, and make notes on your initial
impressions and potential renovation ideas before you visit the
next place and forget. Find out the description in the listing
doesn't match reality? Jot it down.
